**Date:** 2026-05-27 03:17
**Branch:** master (clean before this session)
**Last commit:** `1512cd2 docs(status): session 4 — CI fixes and codebase refactoring`

---

## Session Summary

Investigated `.gitignore`-aware file filtering feature request. After thorough analysis (PRO/CON/effort/dependency), rejected native implementation in favor of documented composition pattern. Delivered research report, website guide, code example, and project documentation updates.

---

## a) FULLY DONE

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| `.gitignore` feature analysis | Full PRO/CON + effort report at `docs/research/gitignore-aware-filtering-analysis.md`. Evaluated 3 options (implement, document, reject). Chose Option B: document composition pattern. |
| Website guide: Gitignore Pre-Filtering | `website/src/content/docs/guides/gitignore-pre-filtering.mdx` — composition pattern with `sabhiram/go-gitignore`, `WithExcludePatterns` alternative, when-to-use-which matrix, recommended libraries |
| Sidebar integration | `website/astro.config.mjs` — added "Gitignore Pre-Filtering" to Guides section |
| Code example | `ExampleWithExcludePatterns_vendorAndTestdata` in `example_test.go` — demonstrates `WithExcludePatterns` with vendor/testdata exclusions |
| FEATURES.md | New "Gitignore-Aware Filtering" section with REJECTED status for native parsing, FULLY_FUNCTIONAL for alternatives |
| AGENTS.md | New gotcha entry documenting the design decision for future sessions |
| Test suite | All tests pass with race detector, 99.8% coverage, zero new lint issues |

## Project-Wide: FULLY DONE (Pre-Session)

| Area | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Core detection engine | ✅ | 11 detectors, two-phase (filename → content), table-driven |
| Filter API | ✅ | Functional options, immutable after construction, `Filter`/`FilterDetailed`/`FilterPaths`/`FilterPathsDetailed` |
| Pattern matching | ✅ | `**` glob via doublestar/v4, `MatchPattern` with absolute path handling |
| Error system | ✅ | Branded errors, sentinel errors, `ErrorCode` type, `ErrorCoder` interface |
| SQLC config discovery | ✅ | v1/v2 format support, FS-agnostic, parent directory search |
| BDD tests | ✅ | ~120 ginkgo specs in `bdd_test.go` |
| Benchmarks | ✅ | All hot paths benchmarked, live dashboard on `gh-pages` |
| Go CI | ✅ | test + vet + lint + govulncheck + benchmarks, 98% coverage threshold |
| Website CI | ✅ | astro check → build → HTML validation → doc validation → dedup check |
| Benchmark CI | ✅ | Auto-push to `gh-pages` on master, regression alerts |
| Release workflow | ✅ | Tag-based GitHub release with automated tests + lint |
| Dependabot | ✅ | Weekly updates for gomod, npm, github-actions |
| Nix flake | ✅ | Root + website, devShell with tools |

## b) PARTIALLY DONE

| Item | Status | Blocking Issue |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Lighthouse CI | Config ready (`lighthouserc.json`) | Needs `LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN` secret configured. Accessibility assertions fail on live site (`color-contrast`, `label-content-name-mismatch` on root page; `redirects` on `/docs`) |
| Code deduplication (Go) | 1 clone group remaining | `types_test.go:240-245` and `types_test.go:246-256` — test table entries with similar structure. art-dupl reports it. Pre-existing, not introduced this session. |

## c) NOT STARTED

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Pre-existing goconst lint issue | Low | `example_test.go:200` — sqlc content string repeated 3x. Not blocking (existed before this session). |
| Website typecheck | Unknown | `npx astro check` not run — npx not in PATH in current shell. CI validates on push. |
| v3.0.3 release | Medium | Multiple improvements since v3.0.2 but no release cut. |

## d) TOTALLY FUCKED UP

Nothing. Zero regressions, zero broken tests, zero new lint issues.

The only pre-existing issue is the single `goconst` warning in `example_test.go` (sqlc content string literal appearing 3 times). This is cosmetic and predates this session.

## e) WHAT WE SHOULD IMPROVE

| # | Area | Current State | Improvement |
|---|------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | Pre-existing goconst | `example_test.go` has 3x repeated sqlc content string | Extract to a shared test constant or use the existing `sqlcGeneratedContentTest` from `helpers_test.go` |
| 2 | Test dedup | 1 art-dupl clone in `types_test.go` test table | Refactor test table entries to reduce structural duplication |
| 3 | Lighthouse CI | Unusable without secret | Configure `LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN` and fix accessibility failures on root page |
| 4 | `go.work` interference | Parent `/home/lars/projects/go.work` breaks `go test ./...` in gogenfilter | Either add gogenfilter to go.work, or use `GOWORK=off` in all scripts/memory |
| 5 | CHANGELOG website sync | CI validates CHANGELOG sections match between root and website | Root CHANGELOG not updated for this session's docs-only changes (no API changes, so arguably not needed) |
| 6 | Website local dev | `npx` not available in current nix shell | Add node/npm to root flake.nix devShell or document `cd website && npx ...` pattern |
| 7 | Dependency count | 50 total modules (including indirect) | Minimal for a library. Production deps are just `doublestar/v4` and `go-faster/yaml`. Healthy. |
| 8 | Coverage | 99.8% | Only untestable `filepath.Abs` error path in `FindProjectRoot` remains. Essentially maxed out. |

## f) Top #25 Things We Should Get Done Next

### High Impact (Pareto top 20%)

| 23 | **Add changelog categories to website** — filter by Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed | 1-2h | Navigation |
| 24 | **Security policy (SECURITY.md)** — vulnerability reporting process | 30min | Professionalism |
| 25 | **Archive old status reports** — move pre-May-25 reports to `docs/status/archive/` (already done, verify completeness) | 15min | Housekeeping |

## g) Top #1 Question I Cannot Figure Out Myself

**Should we add gogenfilter to the parent `go.work` at `/home/lars/projects/go.work`?**

The parent workspace (`/home/lars/projects/go.work`) contains `cmdguard`, `docs-organizer`, `go-error-family`, `go-finding`, `go-output` (with sub-modules) — but not `gogenfilter`. Running `go test ./...` from gogenfilter fails with "directory prefix . is not one of the workspace modules." The workaround is `GOWORK=off`, but this affects DX.

Options:
1. Add `./gogenfilter` to go.work → consistent with other projects
2. Leave as-is, document `GOWORK=off` → gogenfilter stays isolated
3. Remove go.work interference via `.envrc` or `direnv` → automatic per-directory

I cannot decide this because it depends on how you manage your multi-module workspace preferences.
